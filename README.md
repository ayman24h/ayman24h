## 💫 About Me

I am a Mobile Engineer with a strong academic background in Computer Science and a deep interest in software architecture and system design.

My focus is not only on building features, but on structuring applications correctly from the ground up — ensuring scalability, performance, and long-term maintainability.

I approach development with a system-design mindset, prioritizing clean architecture, SOLID principles, and performance-driven implementations.
